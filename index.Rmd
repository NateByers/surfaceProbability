This page provides documentation for the surface probability maps used in the [NetAssessApp](https://github.com/LADCO/NetAssessApp).

## Background
The EPA requires state agencies to assess their air pollution monitoring network every 5 years (40 CFR part 58.10(d)). The next network assessment is due on July 1, 2015. The [NetAssessApp](https://github.com/LADCO/NetAssessApp) was developed by [LADCO](http://www.ladco.org/) and state enironmental agencies in EPA Region 5 to assist with these 5 year network assessments. This online tool was designed as an attempt to update the network assessment tools provided by the EPA for the last network assessment ([see EPA's site for network assessment tools and guidance](http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/network-assessment.html)).
